Additionally, the phrase \"anxious about everything\" implies that the person is experiencing a pervasive and excessive anxiety that is interfering with their daily life. While anxiety can be a normal response to stressful situations, the severity and pervasiveness described in the text suggest that it may be a clinical concern.\n"
